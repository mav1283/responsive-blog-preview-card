## Overview

Based on what i've learned i have implemented the use of css grid and flexbox, using root, variables, fonts and native css nesting.

### The challenge

So far the most tricky part of this challenge is the box shadow, moving shadows with an effect of flicker opacity 0 to 1 while moving in the middle of transition.

## My process

- I started with the HTML5 semantics, getting the exact tags or containers for each part or components
- Combine the powers of flexbox and css grid to align and set things according the the design
- Add external css for the reset, variables and fonts
- Use figma as reference by examining each component and knowing their properties.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Investigating each component in the figma design especially the preset fonts which was tricky at first since you can't see the font sizes.

### Continued development
